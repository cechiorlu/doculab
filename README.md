# Google docs clone

Built with react, socket.io and quill editor.


## Motivation

I use google docs a lot and find its real time collaboration feature fascinating. This project is my way of demystifying the technology behind it. This project is for educational purposes only and not meant for commercial distribution. It is NOT a Google product.
